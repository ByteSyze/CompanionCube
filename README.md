3D-LED-Companion-Cube
=====================

This 3D LED Companion Cube project will contain all necessary information to create a 3D printed companion cube with an
internal circuit to make the hearts flash.

The original companion cube model was created by Poh and downloaded from thingiverse here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33138

The circuit is based on an attiny25/45/85 MCU, that will require additional hardware to program 
(e.g. AVR mkII or ATMEL-ICE).
